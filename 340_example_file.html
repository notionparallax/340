          On a typical day, a long-time user of Goodreads, the world’s largest
          community for reviewing and recommending books, will feel like they’re
          losing their mind. After numerous frustrated attempts to find a major
          new release, to like, comment on, or reply to messages and reviews, to
          add what they’ve read to their “shelf” or to discover new titles,
          users know they’ll be forced to give up, confronted with the fact that
          any basic, expected functionality will evade them. Sometimes even
          checking what they’ve already read will be next to impossible. Across
          a huge range of reading habits and preferences, this the one thing
          that unites millions of Goodreads users: that Goodreads sucks, and is
          just shy of unbearable.
        </p>
        <p>
          There should be nothing in the world more benign than Goodreads, a
          website and app that 90 million people around the world use to find
          new books, track their reading, and attempt to meet people with
          similar tastes. For almost 15 years, it has been the dominant platform
          for readers to rate books and find recommendations. But many of the
          internet’s most dedicated readers now wish they could share their
          enthusiasm for books elsewhere. What should be a cosy, pleasant corner
          of the internet has become a monster.

          Goodreads started off the way you might think: two avid readers, in
          the mid-Noughties, wanting to build space online for people to track,
          share, and talk about books they were reading. Husband and wife Otis
          and Elizabeth Chandler say

          to get recommendations from their literary friends. But it was
          something many others wanted, too: by 2013, the site had swelled to 15
          million users. That year Goodreads it was bought by Amazon, an

          by the tech giant which had, a year earlier, changed the terms of its
          huge books dataset (which Goodreads used to identify titles).
          Goodreads had been forced to move to a different data source, called
          Ingram; the move caused users to lose large amounts of their reading
          records.

          the market share of ebooks, but talking about books happens much more
          online. But now, for many, the utopia Goodreads was founded to create
          has become closer to purgatory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Goodreads today looks and works much as it did when it was launched.
          The design is like a teenager’s 2005 Myspace page: cluttered, random
          and unintuitive. Books fail to appear when searched for, messages fail
          to send, and users are flooded with updates in their timelines that
          have nothing to do with the books they want to read or have read. Many
          now use it purely to track their reading, rather than get
          recommendations or build a community. “It should be my favourite
          platform,” one user told me, “but it’s completely useless.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Discovery is more of a problem for books than for other media, because
          they are so numerous: in 2018, there were
          <a

            >188,000</a
          >
          books. At the same time, however, sales are dominated by a handful of
          bestsellers: in 2018 crime thrillers accounted for the majority of
          fiction sales, with
          <a
            data-short_code="omw1"
            data-simplified_url="twitter.com"

            >one book</a
          >
          alone making up 30 per cent of the non-crime-fiction sales. The
          Chandlers envisioned Goodreads becoming a precise tool to solve this
          problem and encourage more diverse reading, with finely honed,
          specific recommendations based on books that similar users had read
          and discussed. But this is the least reliable and most
          complained-about aspect of what Goodreads claims to offer. Users are
          recommended books in genres they’ve never touched, sometimes simply
          because two books share a word in the title.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the vast amount of books and user data that Goodreads holds, it
          has the potential to create an algorithm so exact that it would be
          unstoppable, and it is hard to imagine anyone objecting to their data
          being used for such a purpose. Instead, it has stagnated: Amazon holds
          on to an effective monopoly on the discussion of new books<span

          In an alternate universe, we could be living with a meticulous tool
          for finding books we would love to read, from a much wider diversity
          of authors. Instead we have a book tracker that, for many people,
          barely works.

        <p>
          All this makes Goodreads an obvious target for a competitor. However,
          it has huge advantages over any new contenders; its megalithic books
          library and its tens of millions of readers give it a very comfortable
          position. But the discontent is quietly reaching breaking point.
        </p>
        <p><span class="star-break">✤ ✤ ✤</span></p>
        <p>
          Ten years ago, Tom Critchlow, an independent strategy consultant from
          the UK (now based in New York), mounted his own challenger to
          Goodreads: 7books, launched in 2010 and now offline, having peaked at
          6,000 users. Since then, Critchlow has been analysing why Goodreads
          competitors tend not to work. Earlier this year, he published a blog
          post called “<a
            data-short_code="HEBQ"
            data-simplified_url="tomcritchlow.com"
            href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/04/15/library-json/"
            >A Proposal for a Decentralized Goodreads</a
          >”. In it, he outlined the fundamental challenges behind creating a
          serious Goodreads competitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          “In my mind, there’s three core reasons that Goodreads remains
          dominant,” he tells me. “Firstly, they are the incumbent with a large
          user base.” Secondly, he explains, the sheer mass of books data Amazon
          holds is unparalleled. Goodreads and Amazon dominate web searches for
          books, which allows them to account for a large proportion of
          book-related internet traffic. While Amazon’s product API, which
          catalogues huge numbers of books, can be used by anyone, it is also
          the only repository of its kind, meaning any new competitor would
          almost certainly have to use the same tools Goodreads has been working
          with for many years.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Amazon,” Critchlow tells me, “has showed no mercy when dealing with
          competitors before.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The final issue Critchlow cites is monetisation: margins on books are
          already “razor-thin”, and most demand goes via Amazon. “If you were to
          compete you would need significant scale,” he says, to make any
          money<span class="wp-mdash from-n-dash"><wbr />—<wbr /></span>and the
          most likely way to make money in the short term would be through
          affiliate links, which pay commission on sending readers to online
          stores<span class="wp-mdash from-n-dash"><wbr />—<wbr /></span>and one
          online store in particular. “Again,” notes Critchlow, ”you’d be
          dealing with Amazon directly.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Critchlow believes all of this all contributes to Amazon doing next to
          nothing to improve Goodreads’s functionality. Amazon has very little
          incentive to improve Goodreads while no serious competitor exists and
          its “core experience” is good enough. “It sees no real threat, so it
          isn’t about to invest behind any major new development,” he tells me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside the lack of incentive, Critchlow also believes that
          Goodreads ultimately still serves the purpose most people use it for.
          “I think a ‘better Goodreads’ is alluring because reading books and
          sharing books is an incredibly emotional experience,” he says. “But…
          keeping a list of books you’ve read and want to read is actually
          served pretty well… Most of the imagined features and social ideas are
          not actually that useful.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Critchlow may be sceptical, but new competitors continue to enter the
          book-tech fray, and one in particular is beginning to make waves.
        </p>
        <p><span class="star-break">✤ ✤ ✤</span></p>
        <p>
          When I tweeted about wanting to leave Goodreads, I received an
          avalanche of recommendations for The StoryGraph from people across the
          English-speaking world. Though still in development, it already has
          tens of thousands of members, attracted by the promise of a place
          beyond Goodreads. Users tell me this platform could be our way out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia Odunayo is The StoryGraph’s founder. She tells me the
          inspiration for the platform came, unsurprisingly, from her
          frustration with Goodreads. Already a tech entrepreneur, she decided
          to drop everything in January 2019 to dedicate herself to making the
          idea work.
        </p>
        <p>
          “For three months I didn’t build anything and I didn’t join in on
          anything, I just spoke to readers,” she tells me. “I spoke to
          Goodreads users, I spoke to book bloggers, I spoke to friends, and I
          just looked at a bunch of different people to try and find out: is
          there still an untapped reader out there?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Odunayo didn’t want to simply create a rejigged version of Goodreads.
          Instead, she tried to find specific “pain points” where readers were
          truly desperate for something Goodreads didn’t offer them. “Through my
          research I essentially ended up on ‘choosing your next book to read’
          and ‘finding persistently high-quality recommendations’ being the
          major pain points”. The StoryGraph has spent the past year fine-tuning
          an algorithm that throws up books its users will genuinely enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The StoryGraph does this through a survey tool called Ordered For You.
          As each reader joins the platform they are prompted to choose from a
          detailed list of features, explaining what they do or don’t like.
          Genres, plot features, types of characters, turn-offs such as “flat
          characters”. Users can also fill in their own reading preferences
          (they give suggestions such as “family sagas” or “LGBTQ+ authors”).
          And Goodreads users can import their account data, so they can add all
          the books they’ve already read into their StoryGraph profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, The StoryGraph recommends books, marked by thematic tags
          and length and accompanied by well-researched synopses. But beyond the
          design and descriptive tags, there is one major difference Goodreads
          users will notice: ratings are almost unnoticeable, deprioritised to
          the bottom of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          “At the end of the day, all of these star ratings are personal,”
          Odunayo says. “And each of our five-star books or four-star books
          probably got that rating for different reasons.” So instead the
          StoryGraph looks at “different dimensions, like mood, and the pace”.
          She believes that rating these features will be the key to creating
          the best set of reader recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
          “If we get the mood right, the pace right, the topic and theme right,
          the type of author, the type of story you want to hear about<span
            class="wp-mdash from-n-dash"
            ><wbr />—<wbr /></span
          >does it matter if the 100 people who read it before you rated it two
          stars? What if it’s actually a five-star read for you? And that’s what
          we’re trying to do,” she says, “uncover books for people, because we
          present them in a different way and show different information
          upfront.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than just offering an explainer of a book’s plot, information
          such as “mood” and “pace” are voted on by The StoryGraph community.
          Next to descriptors such as “reflective” or “dark” are percentages of
          how many readers agree with these descriptions, along with votes on
          whether character development was strong or if the characters were
          loveable<span class="wp-mdash">—<wbr /></span>and then, after all
          that, the star rating.

          Along with a detailed assessment of the effect a book has on its
          readers, Odunayo and her team also plan to implement trigger warnings.
          “You will be able to specify in your survey that you’re sensitive to
          certain triggers and we would be able to flag books with that
          content,” she explains.

          The algorithm used to create The StoryGraph will learn and grow as its
          membership does. For example, when a book that is marked as “dark”
          gets a certain number of people voting that actually it was also
          funny, a new tag will be incorporated to create a more robust picture
          of the book. “We’re trying empower readers to say what they’re looking
          for, to talk to the recommendation system,” Odunayo says. “Almost like
          when you go into a bookshop or a library and you say ‘hey, this is
          what I’m feeling’. We’re trying to recreate that experience.”

          Odunayo recognises the hurdles her start-up faces. The StoryGraph has
          used users’s uploaded Goodreads information to implement book
          information (such as page numbers and publication dates) onto its
          site, but Odunayo and her team have stopped this practice and
          meanwhile spent months manually adding books. At one point she spent
          70 hours straight in a hotel room, uploading new titles and
          researching their moods and themes.
        </p>
        <p>
          To test The StoryGraph for myself, I type in a relatively new and
          niche release, <em>Holiday Heart</em> (a translated Latin American
          novel by Margarita Garcia Robayo from Charco Press). On Goodreads, it
          was almost impossible to find: the first five suggestions were books
          that didn’t even contain both words in their titles, despite the site
          having an entry for the book. On The StoryGraph, even with its
          comparatively tiny pool of readers, the book instantly pops up, with
          detailed descriptions already in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Our system is not as unsubtle,” Odunayo argues, “it won’t say, ‘oh
          you’ve read this book, so we’re going to suddenly change all your
          recommendations to be books like this.’ We have a powerful search
          engine where you can put in exactly the type of authors you’re looking
          for, the type of themes you like, and we’ll find you books that
          exactly match that.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But Tom Critchlow argues that a “better Goodreads”, with functionality
          such as The StoryGraph offers, must avoid falling for the “seductive
          and imaginary ideas about social networks” that doomed a long list of
          previous competitors, including his own. “So many people dream of
          disrupting Goodreads,” he says, “[but] focus on the wrong things,
          myself included.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The StoryGraph is nonetheless off to a good start, with 40,000
          registered users, roughly 5,000 of which spend four to five minutes on
          the site a week, tracking their reading and picking out books. Odunayo
          says the backlash against Big Tech could help her site’s trajectory.
          “There are a lot more people who are looking for reasons to not just
          settle for Amazon products,” she says. She plans to launch The
          StoryGraph early next year, with a fully redesigned app.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We don’t just want to be a better Goodreads”, she says. For the
          company that takes Goodreads’ crown, “the possibilities are so much
          greater”.
